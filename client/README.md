# Client (React + Vite)

This directory contains the React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the **MongoDB User Management Dashboard**.

For full project usage, configuration, and licensing details, see the root [README](../README.md).

## Scripts

From this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Start Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173 with proxy to the API
npm run build    # Build the client into dist/
npm run preview  # Preview the built client
```

In normal development you will typically run everything from the project root using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

which starts both the backend API and this client together.
